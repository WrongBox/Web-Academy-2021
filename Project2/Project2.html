 <p>I do value hope , hope helps everyone, humans are those to hope love, friendship, money, a better life. We all hope for good things but not everyone is lucky enough. Despair comes and kills your hope and your dreams crushed , you fall in despair. Empty is a word to describe this feeling. Hope and despair work together, its a cycle of good and bad , they balance your life. Despair makes you realize the bad and good and helps you grow to change. Together they are good to help you mature and grow.  </p>
